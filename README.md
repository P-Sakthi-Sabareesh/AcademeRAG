# AcademeRAG

The increasing complexity of academic environments necessitates intelligent systems that can support students in accessing, comprehending, and applying knowledge effectively. This project introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based College Assistant, designed to deliver contextually relevant and evidence-grounded responses to student queries. Unlike conventional chatbot frameworks that primarily rely on sentiment analysis or rule-based interactions, the proposed system integrates a neural retrieval module with a generative language model to ensure factual accuracy and contextual grounding. The assistant is capable of addressing diverse information needs, including course-related clarifications, institutional policies, academic resources, and administrative processes. By leveraging retrieval-augmented generation, the system enhances the reliability, transparency, and adaptability of conversational AI in higher education.
